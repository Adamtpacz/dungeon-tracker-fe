# Dungeon Tracker

Dungeon Tracker is a Dungeons & Dragons campaign management application! With Dungeon tracker you can easily and seamlessly create tabletop role playing game campaigns, add battle encounters to them, and pull monster information from the DnD5e API! Gone are the days of manually looking up monster data for your Dungeons & Dragns campaigns. Simply go to the encounter that you would like to add a monster to, type in its name, click "Add", and see the data appear before your eyes!
